# Problem-Solving-Training-

## Please care about Quality not Quantity

- You could solve a 1 million problem without understanding any of them, and this is not useful at all, I want to understand every problem i solve even if it took me 100 years . 

## 1. Resources 
- **USACO Guide**
- **ACM Training**
 * I need to fully finish the gold and silver in USACO guide and fully finish ACM training .

   
## 2. Theoretical Understanding
- Study algorithms and data structures theoretically.
- Focus on understanding the **"why"** and **"how"** of each topic.

* why this algorithm or data structure needed and How can we use it.

## 3. Implementation
- Implement your understanding on paper.
- Move implementations to your **Learning Directory**.

## 4. Problem Solving
- Solve problems related to each topic.
- Track solved problems in your **Problems Directory**:
  - **Problem Name**
  - **Problem Rating**
  - **Title within the Topic** (if applicable)
  - **Difficulty Rating** (if available)
  - **Explanation** in the **Explain File**
  - **Links** to problems in the **Links File**

## 5. Practice 
- Practice algorithms and data structures **4 days a week**.
- Solve IDEAS problems (1500-1700) **3 days a week**.
- Participate in contests based on the topics you study.

## 6. Documentation
- Upload everything to **GitHub** for future reference.
